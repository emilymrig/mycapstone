## Overview

Over the course of a week, scientists collected humidity readings during medium temperature days in northern California. 

## Methods

Scientists used a Raspberry Pi with a temperature and humidity reader and placed them in sand dunes 100 meters, 50 meters, and 20 meters from the ocean and collected measurements

## Notebooks and Code

The following notebooks contain analytical code

### regression.ipynb

This notebook contains the code to read the regression data, build a linear model, and created a line plot

## Data

The data directory contains the following files

### regression.csv

This file contains the regression data collected through the Raspberry Pi measurements
